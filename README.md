# Pair_Trading
A pair trading bot which tracks the banking sector for trading opportunities.
I have mentioned all the necessary steps to use this module in the Colab file itself along with possible pitfalls.
Currently working on making a React website where I can deploy this bot.
I have used Zerodha Varsity for learning the theoretical aspect of Pair Trading
I have used Statsmodels and yfinance documentation for learning to use these libraries and Stackoverflow for solving issues. I have also taken inspiration from the pair trading module by KidQuant however the algorithm I used remains much more simpler and robust and practically used, as mentioned in Zerodha Varsity
